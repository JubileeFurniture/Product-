<h5>Detail Info</h5>
<h3 style="text-align: center">Jubilee Furniture Choice in Leather</h3>
<p>
  Jubilee Furniture strives to deliver the best quality leather that we use in
  our furniture whether it be a sectional, sofa set and bedroom sets. We also
  value our customers input and comments. Based on the majority of our clients
  that have purchased our Italian leathers, their feedback has always been good
  – as in “happy with the quality of the leather,” “it’s very soft to the
  touch,” “love the modern design with the power reclining and adjustable
  headrest,” and much more. (please check our website for more comments). But of
  course, we want to accommodate our other clients that would like to spend
  within their budgets and has opted for bonded leather.

<h4>Italian Leather</h4>
<p>
  Jubilee Furniture has partnered with an Italian company that produces one of
  the best Italian leather. It is then shipped to our manufacturers in China. It
  is called Italian leather because of the tanning method using natural,
  vegetable ingredients that has been invented in the Tuscan tanneries in Italy.
  This is what makes the leather resistant, elastic and smooth. We carry a
  variety of furniture that are Italian leather in different colors. Special
  order is also available.
</p>
<h4>Bonded Leather</h4>
<p>
  In Jubilee Furniture, we recommend for our customers with big families and
  with pets, bonded leather that works well on furniture in high-traffic areas
  like family room or even living room. We make sure that process of the bonded
  leather our manufacturers use contains low levels of environmentally unsafe
  formaldehyde since it does not undergo chemical tanning and is therefore
  suitable for people with leather allergies. Lastly, bonded leather furniture
  is significantly cheaper than real leather.

  <strong><b>Nationwide Shipping information</b></strong>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Unfortunately unexpected delays are sometimes out of our sphere of influence
    and sometimes unavoidable when third parties, as for example shipping
    companies, are involved. Usually there are no complications but in the rare
    event of a delay - please be patient.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-top: 15px">
    Once shipped, orders may not be canceled and are subject to the terms and
    conditions of our return policy.

  <li style="margin-top: 15px">
    Our curbside delivery is exactly how it sounds. A truck arrives with your
    order and drops off your purchase outside your house. Due to COVID-19,
    curbside and white glove service are under two different teams. White Glove
    Service is a separate group that brings your furniture inside and assembles
    the product for you. If you choose white glove service, you will get
    curbside first and the white glove service will arrive to you within 1-2
    business days.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-top: 15px">
    The delivery time starts when our manufacturer receives confirmed orders of
    your purchase. Normally shipment would be timely, but since COVID-19 our
    third-party has been affected. Please understand that we do our best for
    your purchase to arrive on time, but there can be no guarantees.
