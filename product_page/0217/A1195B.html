  Mcmanu Modern Leather Sectional with LED Light
</h2>
<p>
  The McManu Modern Leather Sectional Sofa is what we call a fun addition to
  your living room. This modern leather sectional is ideal for a smaller space.
  This couch features adjustable headrests and storage space at both ends of the
  sectional, perfect for books or decorative items. These storage spaces are
  illuminated by a LED light. It can be optionally upgraded to multi-color
  lights that can be controlled by a wireless remote. Modern design combined
  with advanced innovation for total function and satisfaction. Plush cushions
  are added with color contrasting for more comfort and design.
  <strong
    >This sleek, modern sectional is a must have for every contemporary
    home</strong
  >. To complete the look of your living space we recommend adding the armless
  chair and coffee table. Cup holders and USB ports are recommended for larger
  families to optimize maximum enjoyment. An additional bed function makes a
  great movie night with the family or space for unexpected guests. With the
  generous size of this sectional, family and friends will gladly socialize in
  comfort.

  <strong>Jubilee Furniture Choice in Leather</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Jubilee Furniture strives to deliver the best quality leather that we use in
  our furniture whether it be a sectional, sofa set and bedroom sets. We also
  value our customers input and comments. Based on the majority of our clients
  that have purchased our Italian leathers, their feedback has always been good
  – as in “happy with the quality of the leather,” “it’s very soft to the
  touch,” “love the modern design with the power reclining and adjustable
  headrest,” and much more. (please check our website for more comments). But of
  course, we want to accommodate our other clients that would like to spend
  within their budgets and has opted for bonded leather.

<p><strong>Italian Leather</strong></p>
<p>
  Jubilee Furniture has partnered with an Italian company that produces one of
  the best Italian leather. It is then shipped to our manufacturers in China. It
  is called Italian leather because of the tanning method using natural,
  vegetable ingredients that has been invented in the Tuscan tanneries in Italy.
  This is what makes the Leather resistant, elastic and smooth. We carry a
  variety of furniture that are Italian leather in different colors. Special
  order is also available.
</p>
<p><strong>Bonded Leather</strong></p>
<p>
  In Jubilee Furniture, we recommend for our customers with big families and
  with pets, bonded leather that works well on furniture in high-traffic areas
  like family room or even living room. We make sure that process of the bonded
  leather our manufacturers use contains low levels of environmentally unsafe
  formaldehyde since it does not undergo chemical tanning and is therefore
  suitable for people with leather allergies. Lastly, bonded leather furniture
  is significantly cheaper than real leather.

  <strong><b>Nationwide Shipping information</b></strong>
</p>
<p>
  1.Unfortunately unexpected delays are sometimes out of our sphere of influence
  and sometimes unavoidable when third parties, as for example shipping
  companies, are involved. Usually there are no complications but in the rare
  event of a delay - please be patient.<br /><br />2.Once shipped, orders may
  not be canceled and are subject to the terms and conditions of our return
  policy.<br /><br />3.Our curbside delivery is exactly how it sounds. A truck
  arrives with your order and drops off your purchase outside your house. Due to
  COVID-19, curbside and white glove service are under two different teams.
  White Glove Service is a separate group that brings your furniture inside and
  assembles the product for you. If you choose white glove service, you will get
  curbside first and the white glove service will arrive to you within 1-2
  business days.<br /><br />4.The delivery time starts when our manufacturer
  receives confirmed orders of your purchase. Normally shipment would be timely,
  but since COVID-19 our third-party has been affected. Please understand that
  we do our best for your purchase to arrive on time, but there can be no
  guarantees.<br /><br />5.When orders are released from Long Beach Port, you
  will receive an email that your order has arrived in the US.<br /><br />6.
  Once orders are received in our warehouse, we will contact you and schedule
  the shipment. The shipping company will confirm the exact delivery date via
  e-mail or phone. <br /><br />7.Jubilee Furniture ships and delivers modern
  fine quality furniture nationwide. Restrictions and additional charges may
  apply for shipping to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.
