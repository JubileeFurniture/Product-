<p><strong>Italian Leather</strong></p>
<p>Jubilee Furniture has partnered with an Italian company that produces one of the best Italian leather. It is then shipped to our manufacturers in China. It is called Italian leather because of the tanning method using natural, vegetable ingredients that has been invented in the Tuscan tanneries in Italy. This is what makes the leather resistant, elastic and smooth. We carry a variety of furniture that is Italian leather in different colors. A special order is also available.</p>
<p><strong>Bonded Leather</strong></p>
<p>In Jubilee Furniture, we recommend for our customers with big families and with pets, bonded leather that works well on furniture in high-traffic areas like family rooms or even living rooms. We make sure that the process of the bonded leather our manufacturers use contains low levels of environmentally unsafe formaldehyde since it does not undergo chemical tanning and is, therefore, suitable for people with leather allergies. Lastly, bonded leather furniture is significantly cheaper than real leather.</p>
