<h5>Shipping</h5>
<p><strong><b>Nationwide Shipping information</b></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">1.Unfortunately unexpected delays are sometimes out of our sphere of influence and sometimes unavoidable when third parties, as for example shipping companies, are involved. Usually there are no complications but in the rare event of a delay - please be patient.<br><br>2.Once shipped, orders may not be canceled and are subject to the terms and conditions of our return policy.<br><br>3.Our curbside delivery is exactly how it sounds. A truck arrives with your order and drops off your purchase outside your house. Due to COVID-19, curbside and white glove service are under two different teams. White Glove Service is a separate group that brings your furniture inside and assembles the product for you. If you choose white glove service, you will get curbside first and the white glove service will arrive to you within 1-2 business days.<br><br>4.The delivery time starts when our manufacturer receives confirmed orders of your purchase. Normally shipment would be timely, but since COVID-19 our third-party has been affected. Please understand that we do our best for your purchase to arrive on time, but there can be no guarantees.<br><br>5.When orders are released from Long Beach Port, you will receive an email that your order has arrived in the US.<br><br>6. Once orders are received in our warehouse, we will contact you and schedule the shipment.
